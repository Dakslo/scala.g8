Scala g8 template
==================

## Usage

Install g8 and then use the following command, which will ask a series of questions and then generate a new project directory for you:

	g8 Dakslo/scala.g8

## Linting

For linting, it includes:

* Scalariform
* Scalastyle

Configuration taken from @leifwickland's lint skeleton and recommendations.

## Scalac Defaults

Strict defaults for the scala compiler to make warnings fatal and check for common issues like discarded errors.
